   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file first if it doesn't exist, by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

### Gemini API Key Setup
1. **Obtain a Gemini API Key:**
   - Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create an API key.

2. **Create `secrets.toml`:**
   - In the root directory of your project, create a folder named `.streamlit`.
   - Inside the `.streamlit` folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`.

3. **Add your API key to `secrets.toml`:**
   - Open `secrets.toml` and add the following line, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Gemini API key:
     ```toml
     GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```

## How to Run
1. **Start the Streamlit application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
